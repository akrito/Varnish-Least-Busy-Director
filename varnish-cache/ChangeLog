 * trunk/varnish-cache/bin/varnishd/mgt_child.c,
   trunk/varnish-cache/bin/varnishd/varnishd.c:

   Don my plumbers outfit and twist a lot of pipes into shape:
   
   When -d(ebug) is specified we fork before calling daemon.
   
   The parent process becomes a miniature cat(1) program which connects
   stdin/stdout with the management process stdin/stdout.
   
   It also knows that SIGINT should be passed on to the management process
   in order to make it DTRT.
   
   Any other cause of death for this "debugger" process will (once I
   teach the CLI about it) not affect the running varnish and therefore
   it will be possible to start varnish in debugging mode, tweak things
   a bit and CTRL-D and leave it running in the properly daemon(3)'ed
   background.
   
   The reason for this rather complicated bit of pipework is that we
   can not call daemon(3) once we have started any threads (only the
   calling thread survives) and we would loose our parent relationship
   to the cache process also.

   Implement regexp matching of strings in VCL.
   
   For now we default to REG_EXTENDED, but it might make sense

   Another concern is the stringification of regexps, it may lead
   to backslash madness. Maybe we should define '...' string types
   also and do no backslash substitution in those at all.

   VCL compiler:
   add two sbufs for "init" and "fini" actions.
   
   VCL ACLs: Change syntax and implementation as follows.
   
   ACL Syntax now works the following way:
   
   acl $name {
   ! ( "myhost.com" ) ;
   "10.0.0.1" /8 ;
   }
   
   The '!' means not. If the address matches the rest of the rule
   the address does NOT match the acl and the search terminates here.
   
   Enclosing the string in paranthesis means that the rule will be ignored
   if the string cannot be converted to an address (with getaddrinfo).
   
   When a string can not be looked up, and is not enclosed in a
   paranthesis, a positive rule (ie: without !) will not match and a
   negative rule (with !) will match.
   
   A mask can always be supplied, no matter the style of the string
   given, so it is possible to do things like:
   
   { "fw.ourcompany.dom" / 24 }
   
   Which means "any host on the same /24 subnet as fw.ourcompany.dom".
   
   
   Unfortunately getaddrinfo() does not return a TTL for the results,
   in the future we may want to use some kind of timeout to refresh
   the lookups.

   Record a triplet of {start, data, end} for all HTTP data items.
   
   This represents a regrettable uglification of the sourcecode, but
   most of it compiles out to constants and the runtime benefits will
   be worth it.
   
   Generate H_FOO magic strings for all the headers we know about.
   These strings have a length as first char and always ends in ':'.
   
   Also genereate H_FOO format strings in VCL compiler.
   
   Mandate (with assert) that header references happen using H_FOO strings.
   
   Make number of allowed HTTP headers a compile time constant (32)
   but make the workspace a run-time variable (4096).
   
   Introduce new SHM tag for dumping aborted HTTP protocol requests.

   When during a lookup we encounter a busy object, queue the session on

   This feature is unimportant in normal operation, but crucial to
   resource management if a popular URL suddenly takes a long time to
   reply from the backend.
   
   Without this bit if semi-nasty code, we would tie up one worker
   thread per client while waiting for the backend to come to it's
   senses.

 * trunk/varnish-cache/bin/varnishd/varnishd.c,
   trunk/varnish-cache/include/libvcl.h,
   trunk/varnish-cache/lib/libvcl/vcl_compile.c:

   Teach the VCL compiler about default functions, so that users will
   not have to copy&paste the default methods if they have no special
   requirements for a particular method.
   
   No such facility exists for backends, so a backend description is
   now the minumum VCL program.
   
   When we initialize the VCL compiler we hand it a piece of source code
   with the "default code", this must include definitions of all methods
   named with a "default_" prefix (ie: "default_vcl_recv" etc).
   
   During compilation we always compile this piece of source code in (after
   the user supplied VCL source).
   
   If the user did not provide a particular method, the default method is
   used instead. The user can also call the default method directly,
   for instance by:
   
   sub vcl_recv {
   if (req.http.Expect) {
   error;
   }
   call default_vcl_recv;
   }
   
   Later on, this could be expanded to allow other subroutines to be
   included in the default VCL for the users calling convenience.

   Introduce a struct workreq since the prefetcher (when it happens) will
   not have a session to pass in.
   
   The worker threads get a cond_var each and are hung from a list in
   most recently used order.
   
   When a request is queued and the worker thread list is not empty,
   tickle the cond_var of the first one.
   
   If no threads were availble the max number of threads is not reached,
   try to start another worker thread.
   
   If the max was reached or the start filed (likely due to out of memory)
   indicate overflow and let the existing pool deal with it.
   
   Create only the minimum requested number of threads initially.
   
   Allow specification of the timeout before a dynamic worker thread commits
   suicide to be specified with -w.
   
   Default parameters are -w1,UINT_MAX,10 {min, max, timeout}

   Instead work on a local variable and don't assign to current_base
   until the setup is complete.

 * trunk/varnish-cache/bin/varnishd/storage_file.c:

   mmap as much as the file as we are able to when the cache process opens
   the stevedore.
   
   This should probably be (fine-)tuned later on as it might be too aggressive
   when faced with user errors.
   
   Also, might it be possible to mmap() more than MAX_SIZE_T bytes if
   it is done in multiple calls ?

2006-06-13 13:14  phk

 * trunk/varnish-cache/bin/varnishd/storage_file.c:

   Calculate the size of the backing store file.
   
   A size can be specified in absolute terms (suffix: k, m, g, t supported),
   but also as a percentage of the filesystems free space (suffix '%').
   
   If the specified size is larger than an off_t can cope, we bisect
   repeatedly until it can.
   
   If the size exceeds the available space of the filesystem, we truncate
   to 80% of the free space.
   
   Then round down to an integral number of blocks, sized by the larger
   of the filesystem blocksize and the pagesize.
   
   This was tricker than I'd expected...

   Add the stevedore pointer as an argument to the stevedore alloc function
   so multiple stevedores is possible later on.
   
   Add the stevedore pointer to the storage object, so freeing it again is
   possible.

   constify the array passed around by ParseArgv() and FreeArgv().

   Integrate the VCL code closer in the cache process: The passed
   argument will be the session structure.
   
   Add the pool of worker threads (cache_pool). With a unitary nature
   of the VCL code, the HTTP parsing can be postponed to the worker thread.
   
   This actually helps us with CPU cache locality as it will reduce the
   amount of memory allocated on one CPU but freed on another.

   Add first cut of VCL compiler to the tree.
   
   The Makefile is a temporary shim until I get the auto* stuff working.

   But other than that...
