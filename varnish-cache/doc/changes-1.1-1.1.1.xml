      <para>The code required to allow VCL to read
      <varname>obj.status</varname>, which had accidentally been left
      out, has now been added.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="bug" ref="1750">
      <para>Varnish will now always include a
      <literal>Connection:</literal> header in its reply to the
      client, to avoid possible misunderstandings.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="buf" ref="1751">
      <para>A bug that triggered an assertion failure when generating
      synthetic error documents has been corrected.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="enh" ref="1761,1762,1765,1828">
      <para>A new VCL function, <function>purge_url</function>,
      provides the same functionality as the
      <command>url.purge</command> management command.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="enh" ref="1780">
      <para>Previously, Varnish assumed that the response body should
      be sent only if the request method was <literal>GET</literal>.
      This was a problem for custom request methods (such as
      <literal>PURGE</literal>), so the logic has been changed to
      always send the response body except in the specific case of a
      <literal>HEAD</literal> request.</para>

    <change type="bug" ref="1795">
      <para>Changes to run-time parameters are now correctly
      propagated to the child process.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="bug" ref="1797">
      <para>Due to the way run-time parameters are initialized at
      startup, <command>varnishd</command> previously required the
      <literal>nobody</literal> user and the
      <literal>nogroup</literal> group to exist even if a different
      user and group were specified on the command line.  This has
      been corrected.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="bug" ref="1800">
      <para>Under certain conditions, the VCL compiler would carry on
      after a syntax error instead of exiting after reporting the
      error.  This has been corrected.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="enh" ref="1803-1806">
      <para>The manner in which the hash string is assembled has been
      modified to reduce memory usage and memory-to-memory
      copying.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="bug" ref="1807">
      <para>Before calling <function>vcl_miss</function>, Varnish
      assembles a tentative request object for the backend request
      which will usually follow.  This object would be leaked if
      <function>vcl_miss</function> returned anything else than
      <command>fetch</command>.  This has been corrected.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="bug" ref="1808">
      <para>The code necessary to handle an <command>error</command>
      return from <function>vcl_fetch</function> and
      <function>vcl_deliver</function> had inadvertantly been left
      out.  This has been corrected.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="bug" ref="1810">
      <para>Varnish no longer prints a spurious "child died" message
      (the result of reaping the compiler process) after compiling a
      new VCL configuration.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="bug" ref="1838">
      <para>Under some circumstances, due to an error in the workspace
      management code, Varnish would lose the "tail" of a request,
      i.e. the part of the request that has been received from the
      client but not yet processed.  The most obvious symptom of this
      was that POST requests would work with some browsers but not
      others, depending on details of the browser's HTTP
      implementation.  This has been corrected.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="bug" ref="1855,1859">
      <para>On some platforms, due to incorrect assumptions in the CLI
      code, the management process would crash while processing
      commands received over the management port.  This has been
      corrected.</para>

      (main / lib / devel) as is customary.</para>

      have been addressed.</para>

    <change type="enh" ref="1811">
      <para>The <filename>autogen.sh</filename> script had workarounds
      for problems with the GNU autotools on FreeBSD; these are no
      longer needed and have been removed.</para>

    <change type="enh" ref="1817">
      <para>The <filename>libcompat</filename> library has been
      renamed to <filename>libvarnishcompat</filename> and is now
      dynamic rather than static.  This simplifies the build process
      and resolves an issue with the Mac OS X linker.</para>
