    <change type="bug" ref="1809,1913">
      <para>When switching to a new VCL configuration, a race
      condition exists which may cause Varnish to reference a backend
      which no longer exists (see <ticket ref="144"/>).  This race
      condition has not been entirely eliminated, but it should occur
      less frequently.</para>

    <change type="bug" ref="1942">
      <para>When dropping a TCP session before any requests were
      processed, an assertion would be triggered due to an
      uninitialized timestamp (see <ticket ref="132"/>).  The
      timestamp is now correctly initialized.</para>

    <change type="bug" ref="1955,1976,1977">
      <para>Varnish will now correctly generate a <code>Date:</code>
      header for every response instead of copying the one it got from
      the backend (see <ticket ref="157"/>).</para>

    <change type="bug" ref="1971">
      <para>Comparisons in VCL which involve a non-existent string
      (usually a header which is not present in the request or object
      being processed) would cause a NULL pointer dereference; now the
      comparison will simply fail.</para>

      <para>A bug in the VCL compiler which would cause a double-free
      when processing <literal>include</literal> directives has been
      fixed.</para>
