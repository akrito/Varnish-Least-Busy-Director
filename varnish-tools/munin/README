The scripts in this directory are munin plugins for monitoring varnish.
varnish_cachehitratio and varnish_hitrate are written by Anders
Nordby, while varnish_varnishstat_ is written by Bjørn
Ruberg. All three scripts uses varnishstat to acquire information.

* varnish_cachehitratio shows the cache hit/miss ratio.
* varnish_hitrate shows the rate of requests.
* varnish_varnishstat_ shows the cache usage.

To work with named varnish instances, these scripts will have to be modified
so they can call varnishstat with the appropriate parameter. As of today,
the scripts only call 'varnishstat -1', and thus, will only work if varnishd
was started without the -n parameter. A solution to this problem could be to
let the scripts read a filename from an environment variable (this must then
be set in the munin-plugin configuration), and have this file contain the
name (or names?) to the varnish server(s) to monitor. If the environment
variable is not set, varnishstat will be called without the -n parameter,
and work with the default name.

Dependencies:
* varnish_cachehitration needs the CPAN module Date::Format
* varnish_varnishstart_ needs the CPAN module Net::Telnet
(but does it really? It doesn't seem to use it for anything.)
